# ChatGPT Memories Extension

A Chrome extension to enhance your ChatGPT experience by providing a persistent memory bank for your conversations. This extension allows you to save, categorize, and remind ChatGPT of important information from previous chats, restoring context and improving continuity.

## Why I Created This Extension
I spent my precious time building this because OpenAI can't do shit and made ChatGPT keeps hallucinating.

## Features
- **Memory Bank**: Save important messages from ChatGPT conversations.
- **Categories**: Organize memories into categories for easy retrieval.
- **On-Page Widget**: Access and remind ChatGPT of memories directly from the page via a floating widget.
- **Automatic Reminders**: Optionally remind ChatGPT of your memories when starting a new chat.
- **Visual Timer**: See a timer indicator when using the memory reminder widget.

## How It Works
- The extension injects a widget into the ChatGPT page.
- You can save messages as memories, assign them to categories, and later remind ChatGPT of these memories.
- When you remind ChatGPT, the extension sends a context update prompt with your selected memories.

2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.

## Usage
- Open ChatGPT and look for the ðŸ§  widget on the right side of the page.
